/**
 * @title StableLaunchToken
 * @notice Fixed-supply ERC20 launched straight into a locked single-sided
 * Uniswap v3 position by StableLaunchpad. Two mechanisms live here, both
 * applied ONLY to pool->buyer transfers so third-party routers and terminals
 * can always trade the token (taxing transfers INTO a v3 pool breaks sells):
 *
 *  - Launch window (all flavors): buys in the launch block are rejected
 *    (except the creator's atomic dev buy) and cumulative buys per wallet are
 *    capped at 2% of supply for `SNIPE_WINDOW` seconds. Afterwards the checks
 *    disappear and the token behaves as a plain ERC20.
 *  - Super LP flavor only: a permanent `buyTaxBps` cut of every pool buy is
 *    skimmed to the locker, which pairs it with reinvested pool fees to mint
 *    more permanently locked liquidity.
